# Digital Signal Processing Project

This project encompasses various signal processing tasks implemented in Python. Below are the detailed tasks that have been successfully completed within this project:

## Task 1: Signal Processing Framework
Implemented a Python framework for signal processing with the following features:
- Reading signal samples from a TXT file and displaying them in both continuous and discrete representations.
- Generation of sinusoidal or cosinusoidal signals based on user-defined parameters like amplitude, phase shift, analog frequency, and sampling frequency obeying the sampling theorem.
- Incorporation of a menu for Signal Generation, offering options for sine and cosine wave generation.

## Task 2: Arithmetic Operations
Enhanced the framework with an Arithmetic Operations menu containing functionalities for:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, squaring, shifting, normalization, and accumulation of input signals.

## Task 3: Signal Quantization
Added the capability to quantize input signals based on user-defined levels or number of bits. Displays the quantized signal, quantization error, and encoded signal.

## Task 4: Frequency Domain Analysis
Included a menu named Frequency Domain with features like:
- Application of Fourier transform to input signals and displaying frequency versus amplitude and frequency versus phase relations.
- Modification of signal components' amplitude and phase.
- Signal reconstruction using Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT).
- Saving frequency components in a TXT file in polar form.
- Reconstruction of signals from TXT files containing frequency components.

## Task 5: Additional Frequency Domain Operations
Expanded the Frequency Domain menu to include computing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), choosing coefficients to save in a TXT file, and removing DC component.

## Task 6: Time Domain Manipulation
Implemented a Time Domain menu with functionalities like smoothing, sharpening, delaying or advancing signals, folding signals, and removing DC components in the frequency domain.

## Task 7: Convolution
Added the capability to convolve two signals.

## Task 8: Correlation
Incorporated a Correlation menu enabling the computation of normalized cross-correlation between two signals.

## Task 9: Advanced Frequency Domain Operations
Included features for fast convolution and fast correlation.
